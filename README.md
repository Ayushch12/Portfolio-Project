# ðŸ’€ SQL: The Arcane Queries of Data ðŸ’€

### Unveiling the Code of Shadows:

- **Necromancy of SQL**: This script summons data from the depths of the database, wielding `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and filtering spells to conjure complex results.
  
- **Divination with Subqueries**: Our query uses powerful inner subqueries, reaching into the hidden realms to isolate only the tracks of the "Rock" genre.

- **Arcane Selection**: With `DISTINCT` magic, only the unique combinations of `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name` emerge, untainted by duplicates.

- **Gothic Order**: Data is arranged in a darkly beautiful order, sorting emails in ascending fashion, as befits the balance of the data underworld.

- **Syntax of Shadows**: The code meticulously follows SQL conventions, ensuring each column and table is summoned precisely as required.
